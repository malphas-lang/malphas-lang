# CRITICAL RULES - DO NOT VIOLATE

## NEVER ADD PACKAGE DECLARATIONS TO .mal FILES

**ABSOLUTE RULE:**
- NEVER add ANY package declaration to .mal files (e.g., ` `, `package xyz;`, etc.)
- NEVER create test .mal files with package declarations
- NEVER include package declarations when writing or editing .mal files

**ONLY EXCEPTION:**
- If a .mal file ALREADY has a package declaration, preserve it when editing
- Do NOT add new package declarations even if the file doesn't have one

**THIS IS A HARD RULE. DO NOT FORGET THIS.**
